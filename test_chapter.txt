The morning sun filtered through the dusty windows of the old library. Hanson stood before the towering shelves, his fingers tracing the spines of forgotten books.

"This is it," he whispered to himself. "The answer must be here somewhere."

He pulled down a leather-bound volume, its pages yellowed with age. As he opened it, a photograph slipped out and fluttered to the floor.

Hanson bent down to retrieve it. The image showed a young woman standing before the very library he was in now, but the photograph was dated 1923.

"Impossible," he muttered. The library hadn't been built until 1945.

FLANT appeared in the doorway, her expression grave. "You found something?"

"More than something," Hanson replied, holding up the photograph. "I found a paradox."
